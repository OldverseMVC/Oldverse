<div id="help" class="help-content">
    <p>If you want to be friends with admins (and be able to use this site), please follow these rules.</p>
    <h2>NSFW, NSFL, and other explicit things</h2>
    <p>This is a big no-no, even with spoilers. Doing so will permanently ban you from <?= SITE_NAME ?>. Suggestive art is ok, as long as it is not suggestive to the brim it could basically be explicit.</p>
    <h2>COPPA</h2>
    <p>You must be 13 in order to use <?= SITE_NAME ?>. Joining before the age 13 without parent consent will ban you from <?= SITE_NAME ?> until you're 13.</p>
    <h2>Harassing or bullying someone.</h2>
    <p>This is a big no-no. Doing so will permanently ban you from <?= SITE_NAME ?>.</p>
    <h2>Yeahbombing</h2>
    <p>This is authorized, if not pushed to limits. Limits are defined as:<br> 
    <li>
        <ol>yeahbombing an entire community,</ol>
        <ol>yeahbombing the activity feed,</ol>
        <ol>or yeahbombing an entire profile.</ol>
    </li>
    If you push these limits, you will be banned, usually a week ban, or more if it continues.</p>
    <h2>Raiding</h2>
    <p>Raid and get banned!</p>
    <h2>Reports</h2>
    <p>The way reports should be used is reporting content that violates <?=SITE_NAME?>'s Code of Conduct.</p>
    <p>If you use reports in an innapropriate way (spamming reports, false reports, etc.) you will be banned permanently.</p>
