# **VERY IMPORTANT NOTE**
On November 28, 2022, PHP Foundation will officially drop support for PHP 7. Farewell, PHP 7.

Following this, progress has been made on PHP 8 support, and I'm proud to say it's now complete.

The day my web host will drop PHP 7, Oldverse PHP 7 support will drop too.
Please migrate to PHP 8 ASAP, while you can.

## Oldverse
Codenamed OINM (Oldverse Is Not Miiverse), a new miiverse clone from scratch for the 6564545962598256225th time!!!!!!!

To finally make Grape crappy source code die!!!
# Who created this
Me, and <a href="https://github.com/TermOfficial">terminal</a> from our own fucking bare hands. (what you gotta say about THAT, PF2M?)
# Can I use this
yeah as long as you drop the oldverse name and respect the LICENSE
# How to use this
Well you install it like any classical PHP app, create a new DB, import DB structure, upload website files to your server, modify config.php as you liking.
# is dis from scratch
yup. i actually used very little piece of code from others miiverse clone just to begin, but around 95% of the codebase is 100% me & term.
# Setup the FS3D server
NOTE: config is in the /lib/connect.php file inside the FS3D-Server folder.

Setup the config.

Create a FS3D patch (<a href="https://github.com/Rix565/oldverse-fs3d-patch-tool">Using this repo for example</a>) to redirect the gallery URL to your FS3D server URL.

You're good to go!
