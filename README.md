**Note: the source code will no longer be updated normally from this day on, I finished the unfinished corners of the website.**

# Oldverse
source code
# notice
im done with mvc community. its a toxic place and its cringe. only 5 years old seem to use mvc (except maybe 10 to 20 people are way older)

im releasing this source code because people kept asking for it. so here you go i guess

if you want to create a mvc using this, please don't. mvc are bad things to exist, and are only a waste of time. at least this code will be useful to show my programming skills lol

bye! (below is random info)
# is dis from scratch
the website PHP code itself is pretty much yeah; i only used 5 lines of codes from Miiverse World, and the rest is pretty much 100% me.

however, the fs3d server code contains a file that i havent written, KwzParser.php.
# Setup the FS3D server
NOTE: config is in the /lib/connect.php file inside the FS3D-Server folder.

Setup the config.

Create a FS3D patch (<a href="https://github.com/Rix565/oldverse-fs3d-patch-tool">Using this repo for example</a>) to redirect the gallery URL to your FS3D server URL.

You're good to go!
