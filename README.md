# Oldverse
My Miiverse Clone based off pre-redesign CSS &amp; JS &amp; HTML. Much better than Rixyverse in terms of security and code &amp; features.
# Who created this
Me, and <a href="https://github.com/TermOfficial">terminal</a> from our own fucking bare hands. (what you gotta say about THAT, PF2M?)
# Can I use this
Yes, but check the Do I have the right to use this section of this README.
# How to use this
Well you install it like any classical PHP app, create a new DB, import DB structure, upload website files to your server, modify config.php as you liking.
# is dis from scratch
yes. nobody did that in a while, so we're starting this popular trend again.
# Do I have the right to use this.
use it and get fcked
# Does it will be updated over time
i don't think, codebase has since matured and is safe of use.
