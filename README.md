# Oldverse
source code
# how do i install
you use https://x10hosting.com, then you put the files in the Oldverse-PHP directory on the server, then you configure config.php, and you setup the db.

if you don't know how to setup a database or have basic understanding of web hosting/php hosting then i cant do anything for you
# is dis from scratch
the website PHP code itself is pretty much yeah; i only used 5 lines of codes from Miiverse World, and the rest is pretty much 100% me.

however, the fs3d server code contains a file that i havent written, KwzParser.php.
# Setup the FS3D server
NOTE: config is in the /lib/connect.php file inside the FS3D-Server folder.

Setup the config.

Create a FS3D patch (<a href="https://github.com/Rix565/oldverse-fs3d-patch-tool">Using this repo for example</a>) to redirect the gallery URL to your FS3D server URL.

You're good to go!
